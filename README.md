The application Specchio can be accessed by downloading the files from "specchio-client.zip" or "specchio-installer.jar"

Note: when updating your client or application, you can save your login info by copying the "db_config.txt" file from your old install folder and saving it to the new one before deleting the old application folder. This will allow you to select your existing account when using a new client.
